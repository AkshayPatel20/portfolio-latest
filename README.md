# Akshay Portfolio (React + Tailwind)

This is a modern React conversion of the original HTML/CSS/JS portfolio.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run dev server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Build:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Notes
- Replace images in `public/img/` with your original images.
- Tailwind is configured in `tailwind.config.cjs`.
- The contact form posts to the original PHP endpoint (kept as-is). See `src/services/api.js`.
